<h2> About The Blog </h2>

<p> The Blue Line is a blog dedicated to the average joe fans of the greatest game on earth; Or, on ice. Actually, the greatest game that's on ice. Baseball is pretty cool too, except a pitcher will sit out for 3 months because of a tooth ache and still get paid 8 million dollars. Whatver, the Stanley Cup is the nicest trophy in sports anyway. </p>
